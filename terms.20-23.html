  <h2>20. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
  <h3>Informal Negotiations</h3>
  <p>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other.</p>
  <h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>
  <p>Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Legal Terms, including any question regarding its existence, validity, or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the International Commercial Arbitration Court under the European Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146) according to its rules. The number of arbitrators shall be one (1). The legal seat of arbitration shall be Tokyo, Japan. The language of the proceedings shall be English. The governing law shall be the substantive law of Japan.</p>
  <h3>Restrictions</h3>
  <p>Any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the fullest extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) no Dispute shall be arbitrated on a class-action basis; and (c) there shall be no authority for a Dispute to be brought in a representative capacity on behalf of others.</p>
  <h3>Exceptions</h3>
  <p>The following Disputes are not subject to the above arbitration provisions: (a) enforcement or protection of intellectual property rights; (b) disputes arising from allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use; and (c) claims for injunctive relief.
